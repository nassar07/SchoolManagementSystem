## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SchoolManagementSystem.git
cd SchoolManagementSystem
2️⃣ Configure connection string

In School.API/appsettings.json:

"ConnectionStrings": { 
  "DefaultConnection": "YOUR_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING" 
}


Update AppDbContextFactory.cs in School.Infrastructure/Data:

optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(
    "YOUR_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING",
    sql => sql.MigrationsAssembly(typeof(AppDbContext).Assembly.FullName)
);


3️⃣ Run database migrations

dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p School.Infrastructure -s School.API
dotnet ef database update -p School.Infrastructure -s School.API
